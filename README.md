MyToken This is a simple Solidity smart contract for a custom token called "MyToken".

Description MyToken is a basic ERC20-compatible token implemented in Solidity. It allows minting new tokens and burning existing ones.

Requirements Token Name: Ether Token Abbreviation: Etherium Initial Total Supply: 0 Functions Mint

The mint function allows the creation of new tokens. It takes two parameters: an address and a value. The function increases the total supply by the specified value and increases the balance of the provided address by that amount.

solidity

function mint(address add, uint value) public { // Add 'value' to total supply // Increase balance of 'add' by 'value' } Burn The burn function allows the destruction of existing tokens. It takes two parameters: an address and a value. The function deducts the specified value from the total supply and from the balance of the provided address, given that the balance is greater than or equal to the burn amount.

solidity

function burn(address add, uint value) public { // If balance of 'add' is greater than or equal to 'value' // Deduct 'value' from total supply // Deduct 'value' from balance of 'add' } Usage To use this contract, deploy it to a supported Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and interact with it using Ethereum wallets or other smart contracts. .
